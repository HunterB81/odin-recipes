        <h1>Recipe for some Breaded CHICKEN</h1>

        <img src="../images/Breaded chicken.jpg" alt="Picture of some EPIC Breaded Chicken">

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy,
        crunchy bits, then this significantly less-messy method is for you. One of the keys to this technique is to use panko
        breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged than regular, fine breadcrumbs. This method also allows us to introduce
        some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.</p>

        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            I'm too lazy to list the rest lol.
        </p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)</li>
                <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add chicken breasts. Sear,
                untouched, until bottoms release from the pan, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter and let melt. Add panko bread crumbs. Cook and stir until
                breadcrumbs start to turn golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about
                1 minute. Turn off heat and add parsley and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Set breading aside.</li>
                <li>Combine mayonnaise, balsamic vinegar, agind Dijon mustard in a small bowl. Spread 'glue' over the top
                and sides of the chicken breasts. Spoon over the the breadcrumb mixture. Use a spatula to transfer
                chicken breasts back to the skillet. Pour chicken broth around the chicken.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate and let
                rest while you make the pan sauce.</li>
                <li>Pour chicken broth and lemon juice into the pan. Bring to a boil over high heat and add balsamic vinegar.
                Boil until sauce is reduced, about 2 minutes. Strain sauce and spoon around chicken.</li>
            
            </ol>
